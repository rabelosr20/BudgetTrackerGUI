# BudgetTrackerGUI
Written in Python. This code allows a user to go through and enter a budget for whatever month they choose. Itâ€™ll tell them if they are on track with their budget or if they need to cut costs. If they are on track with their budget it allows them to choose whether or not they would like to cut costs. If they are not it asks them what they would like their target to be. From there it uses the priority assigned to the expenses to cut costs so the user can have a budget that is on track.

This version contains a GUI that includes text boxes for some inputs, drop-down menus for others, and multiple different pages containing all the information.  There is also a version that can be done in the terminal published here.
